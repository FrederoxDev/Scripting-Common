# Scripting-Common

A collection of shared-generic code between all of my scripting projects. The goal isn't to be a complete feature set of everything, I'm simply adding to this as I go along on demand of when I need things.

### Contributing

You can theoretically contribute to this, although I don't really intend for others to use it for the reason mentioned above of this not being a complete set of code. This is more meant as a more convenient way for me to share my own code with me.
